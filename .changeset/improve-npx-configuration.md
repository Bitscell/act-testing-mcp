Improve configuration documentation and add GitHub PR template

- Add npx as the recommended installation method to resolve IDE compatibility issues
- Provide three configuration options: npx (recommended), global, and local development
- Update example configuration to use npx by default
- Add comprehensive GitHub PR template with checklists and sections
- Reference continuedev/continue#4791 about NPX availability problems in IDEs

This makes the MCP server more reliable across different IDE environments and provides better guidance for contributors.
